# Vercel Deployment Requirements
# ===================================
# IMPORTANT: These are the minimal dependencies for Vercel's 250MB limit.
# Heavy ML packages (lightgbm, shap, scikit-learn) are excluded.
# The ML detection features will gracefully degrade to rule-engine only.
#
# To use ALL features, deploy to Railway, Render, or a VPS instead.
